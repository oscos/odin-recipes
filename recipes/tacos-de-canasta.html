        <strong>Tacos de canasta</strong>
        ('basket tacos') are a popular Mexican food preparation consisting of tortilla filled with
        various stews.[2] Typical fillings are papa ('potato'), chicharrón ('rinds'), frijoles
        ('beans') or adobo ('marinade').[4] In all cases, the tacos are bathed in oil or melted butter.
        They are originally from San Vicente Xiloxochitla [es], Tlaxcala, although they are consumed
        throughout central Mexico, especially in the large cities of the country. It is usually sold
        on bicycles that circulate on the streets or also in street stalls. The name comes from the
        basket in which they are kept to keep them warm.

        It is considered a simple, very inexpensive snack (it does not exceed $10 MXN)[5] and is well
        known to all Mexicans, in addition to being highly caloric and satiating. Traditionally, they
        are served with spicy (green or red) sauce, pickled chilies or guacamole.[1]

    Instructions

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300°F. Set foil-wrapped tortillas in oven and allow to warm for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a dry cast iron skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add half of the sliced onion,
            all of the garlic, and all of the chilies and cook, stirring occasionally, until blackened and charred in
            spots. Add 1 cup oil and fry over medium-high heat until garlic and onions are browned and softened, about 3
            minutes. Transfer to a blender, add remaining 1 cup oil and a large pinch of salt, and blend to a smooth
            puree. Transfer chili oil to a small saucepan and keep hot, stirring occasionally so solids don't scorch.
        </li>
        <li>Line basket with a cloth or blanket that's large enough for ample over-hanging fabric. Line cloth with a
            clean plastic bag. Line plastic with sheets of butcher paper.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, remove a packet of tortillas from the oven. Quickly fill each tortilla with beans or
            barbacoa, fold it in half to seal the filling, and set the tacos in the lined basket. When 1 layer of tacos
            is complete, scatter with some of the remaining sliced onion and drizzle hot chili oil on top. Repeat with
            remaining tortillas, fillings, onion, and oil, until basket is full.</li>
        <li>Fold butcher paper over tacos, then twist and seal plastic bag closed, pushing out any excess air. Finally
            fold overhanging cloth over tacos to create a tidy packed basket. Let stand for 1 hour, then open basket and
            serve tacos immediately, passing plenty of salsa on the side.</li>
    </ol>
